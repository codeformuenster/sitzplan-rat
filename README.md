# HTML seating plan for council meetings MÃ¼nster

**This repository reads council member information from oparl and generates a HTML from it. Sadly, the seating information is not part of oparl and needs to be entered manually.**

How does it work?

* The script `generateSitzplan.py` will read all board members of a committee via OParl API interface and then write the member list to the file `config-members.json`, if the file does not exist.
* If the file exists, then it will read the seating information from the field `seat` of every member and then render the committee seating plan to the file `index.html`

## Usage

```bash
    # Step 1: On the first run, the file config-members.json will be generated:
    python3 generateSitzplan.py

    # Step 2: Manually enter the seating information
    # Now you can open the file `config-members.json`
    # and fill out all the seating information in the fields `seat`.

    # Step 3: Run generateSitzplan.py again to generate the index.html
    python3 generateSitzplan.py

```

## Local development instructions

It is easier to fill out the seating information if you get "live feedback". That is why you should do the following:

1. Open shellwindow #1 to watch config files for changes and run our python-script to regenerate the Rats-Sitzplan:

    ```bash
    # Watch for file changes and run generateSitzplan
    #   "-f" => File to watch (can be repeated)
    #   "-c" => Command to execute on file change
    inotify-hookable -f config-members.json -f generateSitzplan.py -c 'python3 generateSitzplan.py'

    # Alternative version:
    #   "-w" => Directory to watch ("dot" = current dir)
    #   "-i" => File patterns to ignore (we ignore html files, because they will be generated, which triggers a recursive call)
    inotify-hookable -w . -i *.html config-members.json -f generateSitzplan.py -c 'python3 generateSitzplan.py'
    ```

2. Open Shellwindow #2 to serve the HTML:

    ```bash
        # Run http server
        python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

3. Open the file `config-members.json` in your favourite editor (e.g. VSCode) and enter the seating information
4. Point your webbrowser to `localhost:8000` and reload from time to time

## Pre 2020 version
We have an old version of this script that basically does exactly the same. The difference is that it uses gatsby.js instead of vanilla python. You can find the old version in the directory "2019".
